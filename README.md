# Personal Learning

Welcome to my code repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects and learning materials I've developed

### Python üêç
##### Sequence Analysis

* [HMM profiler](Python/HMM_profile_analyser)
* [FASTA extractor](Python/manipulation_FASTA/extract%26find_FASTA)

##### Streamlit Apps
* [Clone trigger](streamlit/close_trigger). Given a DNA reference sequence and a DNA intended to be clone it suggests top 20 list of forward and reverse primers that can be used as well as the restriction enzymes. 
* [Prot-Profiler](streamlit/prot-profiler-app). Based on a set of protein sequences it produces a HMM-profile
* [Resume](streamlit/resume). My professional portfolio detailing my experience, availability and different contributions

### R-programming üá∑
##### Omics

* [DEA (Differential Expression Analysis)](R/DEA). Automatized search, cleaning, quality control and analysis of BioStudies reports of a topic (In Progress)
* [postGWAS comparison]() Cleaning and standarization of multiple summary statistics as well as a genetic correlation and pathway analysis contrast (In Progress)
* [GWAS-Cat download](). Download, cleaning and standarization of multiple GWAS-Catalog summary statistics based on a search pattern and a LD reference panel.
* [LD-neighbor algorithm](). Based on a PLINK reference panel and a list of reference alleles, it identifies potential substitutes of these for each summary statistics integrated.
* [Mendelian Randomization]() Automatized causal analyses of pairwise phenotype comparisons based on summary statistics performing IVW, Egger and Weighted Median. Includes quality plots. 

##### Shiny Apps

* [Texas Cheater](shinyR/texas-cheater) A Texas Poker simulator capable to predict your probabilities to win a game based on your game circumstances.
* [Pairwise Alignment](shinyR/pairwise_alignment). Assess the alignemnt of two sequences thorugh dinamyc programming (Watermann algorithm).


### Bash üíª
##### Omics
* [Pairwise genetic correlations](). Using AWK language performs ???? over a folder of summary statistics and develops a matrix summarizing results
