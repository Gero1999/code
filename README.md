# Projects Resume

Welcome to my code repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects and learning materials I've developed

---

### Python üêç
##### Sequence Analysis

* [HMM profiler](Python/HMM_profile_analyser). There are two parts. The profiler, which deduces the state-transition and emission matrices. And the decoder, which guess the most probable sequence. 
* [Nussinov algorithm](Python/Nussinov). Based on a RNA sequence, it predicts the folding and structure of the molecule based on merely dynamic programming.
* [FASTA extractor](Python/manipulation_FASTA). A very simple code to extract, organize and posteriously search information from a FASTA file.

##### Streamlit Apps
* [Clone trigger](streamlit/clone_trigger). Given a DNA reference sequence and a DNA intended to be clone it suggests top 20 list of forward and reverse primers that can be used as well as the restriction enzymes. 
* [Prot-Profiler](streamlit/prot-profiler-app). Based on a set of protein sequences it produces a HMM-profile
* [Resume](streamlit/resume). My professional portfolio detailing my experience, availability and different contributions

##### Machine Learning
* [ML algorithms from scratch](Python/ML_implementations). Just for learning I implement different machine learning without using specific packages for them

### R-programming üá∑
##### Genomics
* [postGWAS comparison](R/postGWAS) Cleaning and standarization of multiple summary statistics as well as a genetic correlation and pathway analysis contrast (In Progress)
* [GWAS-Catalog download](R/GWAS-Catalog-Download). Download, cleaning and standarization of multiple GWAS-Catalog summary statistics based on a search pattern and a LD reference panel.
* [Mendelian Randomization](R/Mendelian_Randomization) Automatized causal analyses of pairwise phenotype comparisons based on summary statistics performing IVW, Egger and Weighted Median. Includes quality plots.

##### Transcriptomics
* [DEA (Differential Expression Analysis)](R/DEA). Automatized search, cleaning, quality control and analysis of BioStudies reports of a topic (In Progress)
* [LD-proxy algorithm](R/LD-proxy). Based on a PLINK reference panel and a list of reference alleles, it identifies potential substitutes of these for each summary statistics integrated.

##### Proteomics
* [Protein Variant Analysis](R/Protein-Variant-Analysis). Analysis and study figures that can be performed over a set of translated DNA coding sequences. 

##### Shiny Apps

* [Texas Cheater](shinyR/texas-cheater) A Texas Poker simulator capable to predict your probabilities to win a game based on your game circumstances.
* [Pairwise Alignment](shinyR/pairwise_alignment). Assess the alignemnt of two sequences thorugh dinamyc programming (Watermann algorithm).

### Bash üíª
##### Omics
* [Pairwise genetic correlations](bash/pairwise_GC). Using AWK language performs the genetic correlation via [LDSC](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc) program and builds a matrix object
