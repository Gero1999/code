<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Welcome to the Pokemon "Who's That Pokemon?" game! If you're a Pokemon
enthusiast or just looking for a fun and nostalgic game, you're in the
right place. Embark on a journey down memory lane as you challenge
yourself to identify your favorite Pokemon characters.

-   Manipulation and edition of images in R
-   Data representation of Pokemon statistics
-   Audio files reproduction in RShiny

## How to play?

The objective of the game is simple: identify the Pokemon from its
silhouette or blurred image. Everytime you do it you will capture the
Pokemon that will be added to your total points/pokeballs. You can at
anytime select which generations of Pokemon do you wanna play. If you
manage to capture all the game is over :)

Guessing the Pokemon is simple. Just choose or write its name in the
black box below and then press "Check". Sometimes you might find easy to
guess the Pokemon. Other times perhaps is more difficult. For those
ocassions you can simply pass (press "Next") or use a hint (press the
"Pokedex" icon).

Test your knowledge and if you need help you can ask for some hints! In
order to play you just need to check the app or press here and start
playing. There are audio files so remember to turn off the volume in
case you prefer to mute the Pokemons!

## Recognition

The result of this Rshiny App has been possible thanks to many other
people who made the data available:

1)  The Pokedex data with the Pokemon information is from a [Kaggle
    dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon)
2)  Images were also obtained from another [Kaggle
    dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arenagrenade/the-complete-pokemon-images-data-set)
3)  Audio files were found on [this
    webpage](https://www.sounds-resource.com/3ds/pokemonultrasunultramoon/)
4)  CSS Gameboy-Pokemon style comes from [this GitHub
    repository](https://github.com/luttje/css-pokemon-gameboy)
5)  Additional decorative images such as the Pokedex were found here or
    the initial Pikagu.gif here.
