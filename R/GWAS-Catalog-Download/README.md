<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Aims of the project


The aim of this project is to download summary statistics from GWAS Catalog:

* Searching for the specified set of phenotypes, ancestries and sample size studies
* Identify potential opportunities of data to download them
* Automatize their identification and standarization to the same standards

## When can be useful to use it?

The code provides simplicity and automatization to researchers and data analysts by streamlining the process of downloading multiple summary statistics files from public repositories. Some of its advantages over traditional search-engine packages or methods: 

* Seaches for you the data. However all metadata related to the study is also provided to you in case you want to check that is in your best interest to exclude the data for your study.

* Multiple Downloads: The code allows you to fetch multiple summary statistics files at once, saving you precious time and effort. Say goodbye to manual downloads and cumbersome data collection processes.

* Data Standardization: The code automatically standardizes the retrieved data, ensuring consistent formatting and compatibility across diverse datasets. 

* Organized Output: With a well-structured output folder, you'll find your downloaded and processed data perfectly organized. The code creates clear and concise folders for each dataset, making it easy to locate and manage your files efficiently.

* Flexibility and Customization: The code is designed to be flexible and customizable. You can easily tailor the parameters to fit your specific research needs, adapting the search queries and data cleaning steps to match your project requirements.
